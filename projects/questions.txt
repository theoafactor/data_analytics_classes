1. Outline 5 differences between Relational Database and Non-Relational Database
2. Use the data below to answer the following questions:

students = [
    {
        "name": "James John",
        "email: "james@gmail.com",
        "age_in_years": 12,
        "gender": "male"
    },

    {
        "name": "Jerry Adams",
        "email: "jerry@gmail.com",
        "age_in_years": 11,
        "gender": "males"
    },

    {
        "name": "Andrew Jacob",
        "email: "andrew12@gmail.com",
        "age_in_years": 13,
        "gender": "male"
    },

    {
        "name": "Akeem Adeyemi",
        "email: "ak2000@gmail.com",
        "age_in_years": 14,
        "gender": "male"
    },

    {
        "name": "Mary Joseph",
        "email: "maryjos@gmail.com",
        "age_in_years": 13,
        "gender": "female"
    },

    {
        "name": "Lola Abraham",
        "email: "lolaabraham@gmail.com",
        "age_in_years": 12,
        "gender": "male"  

    }

]


i. Convert the data above into a csv
ii. Generate first names and last names from each of the 'names' attribute of each 
student.
iii. Write SQL that create a 'database' and a 'students' table from the data provided.
iv. An error occured during data collection, the user with email of 'lolaabraham@gmail.com' 
was assigned a gender of 'male' instead of 'female'. How would correct this error using SQL?
